An iframe (short for inline frame) in HTML is an element that allows you to embed another HTML document within the current document. It creates a rectangular region within the page where another webpage can be displayed. This is often used to embed content from other websites, such as videos, maps, or entire web pages.

Hereâ€™s a basic example of an iframe:

html
Copy code
<iframe src="https://www.example.com" width="600" height="400"></iframe>
In this example:

The src attribute specifies the URL of the page to embed.
The width and height attributes define the size of the iframe in pixels.
Common Attributes of iframe
src: The URL of the page to embed.
width and height: The size of the iframe.
name: The name of the iframe (can be used as the target for links).
frameborder: Specifies whether or not to display a border around the iframe (deprecated in HTML5, use CSS instead).
allow: Specifies a feature policy for the iframe, such as allowing fullscreen mode or autoplay.
sandbox: Adds extra restrictions to the content in the iframe for security purposes.
allowfullscreen: Allows the iframe content to be displayed in fullscreen mode.

allowfullscreen allows the embedded content to be displayed in fullscreen.
sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" restricts the content within the iframe while allowing scripts and same-origin content.
